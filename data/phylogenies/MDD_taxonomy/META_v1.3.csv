MDD_Current,,Current species level listing for the Mammal Diversity Database (MDD)
,sciName,"unique combination of taxonomic genus and specific epithet with an underscore connecting them to be used in the MDD. Uses formula, DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY"
,id,"unique identification number used for indexing and permalinking; initially numbered (14 Sep 2020) as counting up from 1000001 when sorting by phylosort, suborder, infraorder... genus, speciesEpithet; subsequent numbering will be added from 1006485 and up"
,phylosort,"sort the 27 extant orders of mammals according to their phylogenetic hierarchy, following Figure 1 in the Introduction of Checklist of the Mammals of the World (2020)"
,mainCommonName,"common name in the form used in the Handbook of the Mammals of the world series; all words capitalized unless it is the second word in a hyphenated word; directions and any 'and' statements in names are hyphenated (e.g., Black-and-white Ruffed Lemur, South-western Myotis); consistency is attempted throughout a genus in terms of unique name and names based on the genus are typically avoided, although not exclusively (e.g., all Crocidura with the name 'White-toothed Shrew'; the use of White-bellied Rat instead of Niviventer as the common name for the genus); the name is the most broadly encompasing named to avoid confusion when possible (e.g., the use of Wapiti for Cervus canadensis rather than 'Elk', which is also used for Alces alces in Europe)"
,otherCommonNames,other common names that have been used for the species as identified in literature; all names are separated by pipes (|) and follow the same format listed under 'mainCommonName'
,majorType,"higher taxon I (Australosphenida, Placentalia, Marsupialia)"
,majorSubtype,"higher taxon II (Ameridelphia, Australidelphia, Afrotheria, Euarchontoglires, Laurasiatheria, Xenarthra)"
,order,"taxonomic order, all caps"
,suborder,"taxonomic suborder (if applicable), all caps"
,infraorder,"taxonomic parvorder (if applicable), all caps"
,parvorder,"taxonomic infraorder (if applicable), all caps"
,superfamily,"taxonomic superfamily (if applicable), all caps"
,family,"taxonomic family, all caps"
,subfamily,"taxonomic subfamily (if applicable), all caps"
,tribe,"taxonomic tribe (if applicable), all caps"
,genus,taxonomic genus
,specificEpithet,taxonomic species epithet
,authoritySpeciesAuthor,"species authority: author last name(s) that first described the species following typical guidelines for format with specifics listed here; all authors on the author line of the publication in which the species is described are included; a comma is presented after the second to last name if there are more than two authors (e.g., S. E. Pavan, Mendes-Oliveira, & Voss); if the volume was described in a book or journal article with a differing set of editors/authors in the author line, an 'in' is used after the initial authors, followed by the editors/authors of the primary text (e.g., Ambrose in Butynski, Kingdon, & Kalina); when two authors share the same surname, the initials are added before the surname in both cases, and if they share the same initials, than the middle name is also written out (e.g. J. A. Allen and G. M. Allen); for names of Chinese, Korean, and Indochinese origin, the full name is writen out with the suriname put first and hyphens removed to match the format typically given in Chinese publication (e.g., Kuo Haochih, Fang Yinping, Csorba, & Lee Lingling); the suffix 'Jr.' is not included in any name unless it is fully spelt out and part of the surname"
,authoritySpeciesYear,species authority: year that author first described the species
,authorityParentheses,0 for no parentheses around authority; 1 for parentheses around authority
,originalNameCombination,the name combination for each species as it appears in the original description
,authoritySpeciesCitation,"full literature citation of the authority publication as well as the page in which the name either first appears (in older publications, or when an obvious description is unavailable) or where the obvious description of the species begins; citations for papers written in languages other than English are writen in the language in which they appear with the exception of non-latanic lettering (e.g., Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese), in which case the citation is translated to English and a disclaimer is added in brackets after the citations page number (e.g., [original in Chinese]); the citation is in APA format in concordance with the following examples; journal publication - García, F. J., Sánchez-Hernández, J., & Semedo, T. B. (2014). Descripción de una nueva especie de comadrejita ratona del género Marmosops Matschie, 1916 (Didelphimorphia, Didelphidae).

,nominalNames,"all nominal specific epithets included under the current definition of the pertinent species including the authority and year with a comma and in parentheses when originally named in a different genus (O. Thomas, 1900); this includes the current name of the species and all nominal senior and junior synonyms, but not subsequent misspelling, earlier spellings under different genera, or name combinations; listed in the style of MSW3 with authorities formated in the same way as the 'authoritySpeciesAuthor' column; if a name is a nomen nudum, nomen dubium, nomen oblitum, or nomen inquirendum, it is listed after the authority in brackets ([nomen nudum]); if a name was preoccupied, the name that preoccupies it is mentioned in brackets after the authority ([preoccupied by pallidus, Thomas, 1899, a synonym of Caluromys derbianus]]); also noted are changes to gender if the gender of the name is changed to match the genus in which the species occurs."

,extinct,"0 = extant, 1 = extinct; species has gone entirely extinct or is expected to have become extinct in the last ~500 years (similar criterion as used by IUCN)"
,domestic,"0 = species is wild; 1 = species is domesticated; domestic species are treated as distinct entities for politicaly/conservation purposes here for species with ancient domestication history (19 species in total, including Homo sapiens); this arrangement follows guidelines from the following publication - Gentry, A., Clutton-Brock, J., & Groves, C. P. (2004). The naming of wild animal species and their domestic derivatives. Journal of Archaeological Science, 31(5), 645-651."
